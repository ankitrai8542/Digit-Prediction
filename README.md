# Digit-Prediction
Prediction of hand drawn numbers.
In this we have used digit based dataset which you can extract from zip files contaning for numbers 1,2 and 3.
In the next step we have run our data through PCA fro efficiency and then used hand drawn .png files made via ms-paint in 28*28 pixel ratio. 
For image conversion we have used open-cv and os for accesing directories. 
Then we have trained our model using logistic regression and predict the numbers. You can use this for all (0-9) numbers. dataset is available on many sites or you can make your own.
